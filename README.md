<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Jonathan (or Jon -- either is fine)</h1>
- 🔭 I’m studying at [the Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **a bunch of lower-level stuff in C I hope I never have to use again.**

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **something QA related. I love QA and would love any opportunity to get started on real life QA in an actual production environment.**

- 👨‍💻 (Most) of my projects are available at [https://github.com/jorbian](https://github.com/jorbian)

- 📝 I regularly write articles on [my-personal-website-I-haven't-set-up-yet.](my-personal-website-I-haven't-set-up-yet.)

- 💬 Ask me about **how the Lambda Calculus can be used to explore one of the deepest mysteries of the universe.**

- 📫 How to reach me **jonathan.boller@yahoo.co.uk**

- ⚡ Fun fact **I never knew what it was like to fall in love with a city until I went to Porto, Portugal. Love the people. Love the language. One of my dearest ambitions in life is to end up back there, drinking Super Bock and obsessing about FC Porto**
